My name is Kun Yuan, a Ph.D. student, co-supervised by Prof. [Nicolas PADOY](http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/npadoy) (Université de Strasbourg) and Prof. [Nassir NAVAB](https://www.professoren.tum.de/navab-nassir) (Technische Universität München). My research focus is the AI in healthcare, especially to design the computer vision based algorithms to build multiple applications in the laparoscopic surgeries and robotic surgeries. I am also interested in the multi-moidality learning with vision and language in surgical field. I am always open to collaboration. Feel free to drop me an e-mail.
